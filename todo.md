# TODO LIST

[X] DEFINE THE GAME : CHOMP
[ ] ASSURE THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS A UNIQUE ID
[ ] DEFINE THE MATCHMAKING BASED ON THE ELO
[ ] DEFINE RANKS
[ ] DEFINE INDIVIDUALS (gp individuals? grid policy individuals?)
[ ] TUNE THE ELO
[ ] IMPROVE THE ELO TWEAKING THE VARIANCE
[ ] DEFINE MUTATIONS AND CROSSOVERS (with placements matches and so on)
[ ] THINK IF THE RANKS ARE ROBUST ENOUGH TO ENSURE THE SAME EFFECT AS THE HALL OF FAME

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

[ ] CHANGE FROM ELO TO GLICKO/TRUESKILL2/BAYESELO
[ ] HAVING AN OVERALL ELO AND A "PLAYER AGAINST CLASS OF PLAYER" ELO (BASED ON A BETA MAYBE) CAPABLE OF "ESCAPING" INTRANSITIVITY
