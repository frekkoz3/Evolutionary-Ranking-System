# TODO LIST

[X] DEFINE THE GAME : BOXING 2600 VARIANT
[X] ASSURE THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS A UNIQUE ID
[X] PARALLELIZE THE MATCHES
[X] DEFINE INDIVIDUALS : DQN NETWORKS
[ ] INSTALLING TORCH WITH CUDA
[ ] DEFINE THE MATCHMAKING BASED ON THE ELO
[ ] DEFINE MUTATIONS AND CROSSOVERS (with placements matches and so on) -> study of how we can mix policies to sped up training
[ ] THINK IF THE RANKS ARE ROBUST ENOUGH TO ENSURE THE SAME EFFECT AS THE HALL OF FAME
[ ] ADD A CONFIG FILE OR A CONFIGURATION MECHANISM FOR THE TOURNAMENT.PY (FOR THE PLAY FUNCTION)
[ ] TUNING THE FPS AND ANIMATION FRAME RATE
[ ] IMPROVE README FOR THE BOXING

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

[ ] DEFINE RANKS
[ ] CHANGE FROM ELO TO GLICKO/TRUESKILL2/BAYESELO
[ ] HAVING AN OVERALL ELO AND A "PLAYER AGAINST CLASS OF PLAYER" ELO (BASED ON A BETA MAYBE) CAPABLE OF "ESCAPING" INTRANSITIVITY
[ ] IF WE WANT TO AVOID A LOT OF DEEPCOPY AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THIS (that are indeed necessary for now using joblib and/or ray) WE WILL NEED TO REWRITE THE CLASS ITSELF SUCH THAT THE ATTRIBUTES CAN ACTUALLY STAY ON A REAL SHARED MEMORY (ON NUMPY ARRAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS)
