# TODO LIST

[ ] ALL THE HYPERPARAMETERS IN THE DQN AGENT SHOULD BE SOMEHOW CONFIGURED BY A CONFIG
[ ] IMPLEMENT THE R2D2
[ ] UNDERSTAND BETTER HOW TO TUNE THE ELO

## OTHER IDEAS

[ ] DEFINE RANKS
[ ] CHANGE FROM ELO TO GLICKO/TRUESKILL2/BAYESELO
[ ] HAVING AN OVERALL ELO AND A "PLAYER AGAINST CLASS OF PLAYER" ELO (BASED ON A BETA MAYBE) CAPABLE OF "ESCAPING" INTRANSITIVITY
[ ] IF WE WANT TO AVOID A LOT OF DEEPCOPY AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THIS (that are indeed necessary for now using joblib and/or ray) WE WILL NEED TO REWRITE   THE CLASS ITSELF SUCH THAT THE ATTRIBUTES CAN ACTUALLY STAY ON A REAL SHARED MEMORY (ON NUMPY ARRAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS)
[ ] THINK IF THE RANKS ARE ROBUST ENOUGH TO ENSURE THE SAME EFFECT AS THE HALL OF FAME
